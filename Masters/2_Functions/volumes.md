# volumes.py

Create a python file `volumes.py` in your Working directory. 

### 1) Volume Functions
Define functions that **return** the volume of each of the following shapes:

* cylinder
* cone
* sphere

Your functions should be defined with the `radius` and `height` parameters(where applicable) ([see formulas](http://www.math.com/tables/geometry/volumes.htm)).  The functions are not to print anything out, **only return volume values**.


### 2) Main program
Define a main function that tests your volume functions by getting a `radius` and `height` values from user input and outputs volumes for the respective shapes using the appropriate functions defined in part 1.

Running the program should look like this:

```text
Enter a radius: 5
Enter a height: 10

The volume of a cylinder is 785.4.
The volume of a cone is 261.8.
The volume of a sphere is 523.59878.
```

Don't forget to call your `main()` function at the end of your program
